# Terraform Workshop

This repository contains the code that is demoed during the presentation **"Infrastructure as Code with Terraform"** given by Besart Sulejmani. </br>

The PowerPoint slide deck has been added to this repository. Make sure to check the "notes" in each PowerPoint slide for extra information. I recommend to go through the PowerPoint slide deck before starting to work with the configurations and instructions.

</br>

README files have been added in each configuration folder as an instruction set to help you go over the demos by yourself.
